# Cache Viewer
Adds a ::cache command that opens an interface displaying cache related data


Catagories included:
Sprites
Models
NPCs
Chatheads
Items


Search via ID or use the left/right arrow keys to quickly view models/sprites
Zoom/Rotate models



Sprites catagory technically is missing some sprites as we're not using archive ids
NPC models overlap eachother as we're using widgets to display multiple models
